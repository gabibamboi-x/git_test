Day 1 July 12th:
    GIT and GITHUB
    Today i learned about git and github. I read a few articles about it's history and how the linux community invented this DVCS (Distributed Version Control Systems). This technology alows developers to work together on the same projects and keeps a snapshot of the code in case someone decides to return to an older version of their code. It's an awesome 'backup' for every project in case things go sideways while implementing a new feature. Github is a website that offers an easier and more convenient way to work on a project, solo or as a team with more developers.
    It is not designed just for Programmers but also for Artists, Designers...

    Introduction to HTML, CSS and JS
    After learning about GIT i continued the introductory lessons and learned what HTML, CSS and JS are, how they work together and the basics of HTML (html tags, elements, creating a boilerplate). After reading the given articles i did the assignment where i had to create a boilerplate and open in in my browser to see the result. I feel like this has been a productive day and i'm looking forward to the next lessons.
